//write vector_add function that takes two vectors as parameters and returns a vector that is the sum of the two vectors

//write vector_dot function that takes two vectors as parameters and returns a float which is the dot product (look it up if you don't know what a dot product is)

//write vector_normalize function that takes a pointer to a vector as a parameter and modify the vector by dividing each of the x,y,z components by its length. Check if the length is zero and return 1 if it is zero (unsuccessful normalization) , otherwise return 0 (successful normalization)
